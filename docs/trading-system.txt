A **Trading System** is defined as a quantified process and a defined approach to trading the markets, as opposed to ad-hoc methods like trading based on gut feel, tips, or news recommendations.

Here is a breakdown of what constitutes a trading system:

### 1. The Core Structure
A trading system acts as a structured workflow:
*   **Inputs:** You provide the system with market-based inputs.
*   **Logic:** The system performs a specific set of tasks or calculations based on a pre-designed logic.
*   **Output:** It generates an output which you interpret.
*   **Decision:** Based on the output, a decision is made on whether to take the trade or not.

### 2. Key Components
A complete trading system must possess the following four elements:
1.  **The Logic:** This is the core strategy or the "why" behind the trade.
2.  **Input Parameters:** The specific data points required for the logic to function.
3.  **Output Interpretation:** A clear method for reading the results generated by the system.
4.  **Decision Rules:** Strict rules on when to enter or avoid a trade.

### 3. What it is NOT
*   **Not Ad-Hoc:** It is distinct from trading based on "systematic deduction" (which can suffer from cognitive biases), tips from friends, TV analysts, or broker calls. If an approach cannot be defined as a process, it is not a trading system,.
*   **Not a Holy Grail:** A trading system is not a "sure shot technique" or a "money-making machine" that guarantees profits from the first trade. It is simply a tool where the onus of designing the logic and following the discipline lies with the trader,.

In summary, a trading system turns trading into a methodical process where you define the logic once and then strictly follow the system's output to make trading decisions.
