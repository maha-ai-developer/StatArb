The management has maintained a strong brand reputation and consistent growth. While there have been some analyst notes regarding executive compensation and the complexity of recent restructuring (HealthCo stake sale), the overall governance track record is considered robust. The recent shift to a net cash positive position following the HealthCo stake sale further strengthens the financial stewardship narrative."
