Despite occasional whistleblower complaints (e.g., in 2019) which were investigated and largely cleared, the management, led by CEO Salil Parekh, maintains a high reputation for integrity. Recent reports from 2024 indicate no material governance failures, and the company continues to uphold high disclosure norms."
