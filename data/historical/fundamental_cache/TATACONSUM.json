The leadership has successfully executed a strategic transformation from a commodities player to a diversified FMCG company, expanding into high-growth segments like pulses (Sampann) and ready-to-eat/drink categories. Despite high valuation multiples, the management's focus on premiumization, innovation (launching 40+ products annually), and expanding distribution reach (4M+ outlets) underscores a strong long-term vision."
