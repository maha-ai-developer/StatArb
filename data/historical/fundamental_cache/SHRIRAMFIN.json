High institutional holding (approx. 68%) and the recent strategic investment by global banking giant MUFG (acquiring a 20% stake) reinforce confidence in the management's integrity and strategic direction. The successful merger of Shriram Transport and Shriram City Union further demonstrates execution capability."
