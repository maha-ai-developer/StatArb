      "reasoning": "Grasim Industries, the flagship company of the Aditya Birla Group, is a diversified conglomerate with leadership positions in Viscose Staple Fibre (VSF) and Chemicals, plus a majority stake in UltraTech Cement and Aditya Birla Capital. The negative free cash flow and high debt figures in the consolidated books are largely attributed to the capital-intensive nature of its subsidiaries (financial services lending and cement capacity expansion) and its own aggressive entry into the Paints business (Birla Opus). Management integrity is widely regarded as high. Valuation is typically done using Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) rather than a simple DCF due to its holding company structure and diverse business lines."
